# Letterboard application stack

## About This App

This is a full-stack application leveraging Typescript, React, NodeJS and Redis.  This is a pet project to better familiarize myself with React, Typescript, Containerization, and microservices.

A letterboard is simply a space that allows letters to be individually arranged.  Each instance of the client application draws from the same source of letters and their positioning.  Moving letters on any instance of the letterboard will be reflected in all other instances of the letterboard.

## Running This App

From the home folder, run the following commands:

`$ docker-compose build`

`$ docker-compose up`
